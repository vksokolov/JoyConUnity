# JoyConUnity

Thanks to [Looking-Glass](https://github.com/Looking-Glass) and [wormyrocks](https://github.com/wormyrocks) for [their JoyCon lib for Unity](https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib), which apparently hadn't all the scripts and doesn't work at "as is" state

Thanks to [gb2111](https://github.com/gb2111) for [JoyconLib-4-CS](https://github.com/gb2111/JoyconLib-4-CS)

This project build from these two and contains an Example Scene
I've tested it on Win10, works perfectly for me

# How to

1. Connect your JoyCons to PC ([How To](https://www.alphr.com/connect-switch-controller-pc/))
2. Open this project in Unity
3. Open *ExampleScene*
4. Press "Play"
5. If everything is ok, you can press physical buttons and see their state on screen (see gif)

# About support and known issues

I didn't test it on diffent platforms and don't even know what's inside these **.dll**s, I also won't support it.
The main reason of this repo is to save some hours of researching for developers who want to try JoyCons without waiting for Unity Technologies to support controllers in their [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/QuickStartGuide.html)
